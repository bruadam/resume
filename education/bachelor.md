## Key Areas of Focus
- **Architectural Design & Composition**: Gained hands-on experience through multiple architectural studios, with a focus on bioclimatic design, ergonomic principles, and graphic communication.  
- **Sustainable Building Techniques**: Focused on energy-efficient building systems, including the study of sustainable construction techniques for building envelopes, networks, and structural elements (e.g., reinforced concrete, metallic, and wood structures).  
- **Structural Engineering**: Explored the structural design of buildings, including reinforced concrete and metallic elements calculation, with courses on introduction to structural engineering and geotechnics.  
- **Building Analysis & Programming**: Enhanced skills in digital architectural modeling and programming for building analysis, including thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and numerical methods.  
- **Urban Planning & Site Analysis**: Studied urban planning and site analysis, incorporating environmental and functional aspects into the design process.  
- **Project Management**: Gained a solid understanding of project management principles, supporting effective execution and coordination of architectural projects.  
- **Mathematics & Physics**: Built a strong foundation in mathematical analysis, algebra, and physics (mechanics, thermodynamics, electricity), with applications to building design and engineering.

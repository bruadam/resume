## Building Performance Simulation

In the [Building Performance Simulation](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2022-2023/41462) course, I guided students in using **IDA ICE** to analyze and optimize building designs. Working alongside **Professor Jakub Kolarik**, I facilitated hands-on exercises, enabling students to apply theoretical knowledge in realistic scenarios and develop their skills in energy performance simulation.

### Key Skills:

- **Building Performance Simulation**: Enabled students to model energy and climate impacts of building designs.  
- **IDA ICE**: Supported students in mastering this software for comprehensive building analysis.  
- **Energy Optimization**: Taught techniques to enhance energy efficiency in architectural designs.  

## Indoor Climate

In the [Indoor Climate](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2022-2023/12360) course, I assisted **Professor Geo Henrik Clausen** by providing students with practical experience in in-situ measurements. My role focused on helping students understand how gases build up and decay in indoor environments with varying activity levels. We applied basic models to track CO2 concentration over time, exploring how human CO2 emissions changes over time.

I assisted students during the experiments, guiding them through the process of measuring and analyzing gas concentration, as well as writing their reports. Additionally, I helped them measure the **air change rate** using **gas tracing techniques**, which is essential for evaluating ventilation efficiency.

### Key Skills:

- **In-situ Measurements**: Delivered practical sessions on measuring indoor environmental quality.  
- **Gas Tracing Technique**: Assisted students in measuring air change rates for improved ventilation assessments.  
- **Gas Build-up and Decay Models**: Supported students in understanding how ventilation influences indoor gas dynamics.  
- **Report Writing**: Guided students in documenting and analyzing experimental results.
